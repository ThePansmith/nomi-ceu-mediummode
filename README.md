# nomi-ceu: medium mode 

Medium Mode blends together expert mode's new automation challenges (such as no DML, harder chains, etc) with normal mode's faster earlygame, along with some of it's own features. This fork's mode is medium mode by default, but the other modes and their configs are still present.

### A list of Medium Mode changes, compared to hard mode:
- Steam age has been re-removed
- Wrought Iron can be made via smelting Iron Ingots
- Charcoal can be made in a furnace again
- Coins return, refer to its quest for more detail.
- AE2 has been changed to be more like a "New Game+", coming earlier than normal.
- Steel can be made in an alloy furnace again
- Various quest fixes
- Various earlygame recipe nerfs applied by hardmode have been reverted

## Installing
Simply just paste everything in the overrides folder into your .minecraft folder. By default, your pack difficulty will be changed to medium, if you prefer not having that take place, do not include the config folder in your paste. The reason for both config and config-override existing is so that you can easily switch pack difficulty, in the same way that you would change to normal/hardmode.
If you are on an existing world, run /bq_admin default load to load the hard mode questbook.
